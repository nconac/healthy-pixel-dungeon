# Healthy Pixel Dungeon

This is a fork of Shattered Pixel Dungeon, that I made for personal use.
The only change I aim to implement is to make health potion discovered at start for all heroes, not just the warrior.
Instead, the warrior will start with haste potions knwon.
The reason behind this change is that I find health potions to precious to waste while not discovered, and the current state mean I limit myself to playing warrior only.
I discourage everyone from using thi project, as I know fuck all about java, and I'm not sure when it'll be playable.
All credit of course go to 00-Evan, for the Shattered Dungeon Pixel source code, and Watabou, for the original Pixel Dungeon source code.
